# Modern Walk – Frontend Prototype

This project is a prototype implementation of the **Modern Walk** fashion retail web application, developed as part of the **WireApps Front-End Technical Assessment**.  
The objective was to build a working prototype based on the given Figma design using the specified technologies and to deliver the core features within the limited timeline.

## Setup Instructions

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atheekazmy/nextjs-modern-walk.git
cd modern-walk
```

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Visit the app at:**

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript – for type safety and improved developer experience
- Tailwind CSS – for efficient and scalable styling
- ShadCN UI – for reusable and consistent UI components
- React Query – for data fetching and caching
- Zustand – for lightweight global state management (e.g., cart handling)
- Fake Store API – used as the data source
- Moment – for date handling

## Timeframe & Scope

This project was completed within the **4-day time limit** provided for the assessment.  
The main focus was on building a functional, design-aligned, and maintainable prototype that reflects the Figma design as closely as possible.

Due to the short timeframe, I prioritized implementing the **core user flows** and **reusable components** essential for demonstrating the overall architecture and functionality.

## What Could Be Improved with More Time

If I had a few more days (including a weekend), I would have:

- Implemented additional UI sections such as the Footer, Sales Banner, and Newsletter
- Added loading and error states with improved animations or skeleton placeholders
- Enhanced unit testing coverage
- Made the UI more responsive for smaller devices
- Added error boundaries and better error handling across pages
- Refactored some parts of the codebase for cleaner structure and moved repeated logic into custom hooks

---

## Notes

- This is a **prototype version**, not a production-ready build.
- Only the essential features were implemented to demonstrate design accuracy, proper state management, and overall architecture.
- Some non-critical UI sections (e.g., newsletter, footer) were intentionally skipped to maximize delivery within the given time frame.
